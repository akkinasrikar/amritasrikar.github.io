Mata Amritanandamayi - The Guiding Light of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham

A renowned humanitarian leader and spiritual teacher, Sri Mata Amritanandamayi is the guiding light of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. Amma’s concept of education, stress on research and commitment to instilling universal values have come together to shape Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham into an institution where the latest advancements and discoveries combine with compassion and service-mindedness. As Mata Amritanandamayi said in 2010 when the State University of New York honored her with an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters: “It is Amma’s prayer that we develop the expansive-mindedness to embrace both scientific knowledge and spiritual wisdom. We can no longer afford to see these two streams of knowledge as flowing in opposite directions. In truth, they complement one another. If we merge these streams, we will find that we are able to create a mighty river—a river whose waters can remove suffering and spread life to all of humanity.”

Aside from serving as the Chancellor of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Mata Amritanandamayi also runs the vast humanitarian mission known as the Mata Amritanandamayi Math, the headquarters of which is home to one of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham’s five campuses. A world-renowned institution, the Mata Amritanandamayi Math has built more than 45,000 homes for the homeless poor throughout India, is currently providing scholarships for more than 46,000 impoverished children, and has helped more than one lakh poverty-stricken women form self-help groups, and much more.

Mata Amritanandamayi is also a spiritual guide and teacher to millions throughout the world, giving people through her teachings and emotional support the strength to face the challenges of life with peace and mental equanimity. Her days are spent receiving thousands, placing men, women and children on her shoulder, addressing their concerns and instilling in them the confidence and inner strength to move forward in life. In this manner, more than 34 million people have come to Amma for her darshan</font></p>
